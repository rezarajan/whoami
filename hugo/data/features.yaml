  details: |
    Self-motivated software engineer with professional experience in building robust data systems.

    Academic background in Mechanical Engineering with further studies in Autonomous Robotics. Along this learning path, I have had the opportunity to train ML models for real-time object detection; ultimately this sparked my passion for working with data.

    My focus is on building pragmatic solutions to real-world problems, aiming for simplicity and felxibility at each step.
