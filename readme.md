# Projects

Most of my time is spent working on projects - both in production and hobbyist. These projects help me stay engaged with the latest technology developments, as well as gain a working understanding of their implications in a real-world environment.

| [dotfiles](https://github.com/rezarajan/dotfiles)           | A collection of my Linux configurations, mostly focused on Nix. It helps me learn which tools are the most effective at bootstrapping Linux systems from scratch, and the drawbacks of each.                                                                                                    | Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC), Linux, Nix, Bash |
| [mbok](https://github.com/mochipool/mbok)                   | Internal documentation for Mochi, a Web3 project. This project has helped me learn what constitutes good technical documentation, and how to share that among stakeholders effectively.                                                                                                         | Hugo, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)                   |
| [mainline (private)](https://github.com/mochipool/mainline) | This repository contains source code for microservices run in the Mochi project. Microservices are usually written in Golang, development environments created with Nix, containerized build systems run with Earthly, and deployments done using Kustomize or Flux across Kubernetes clusters. | Kubernetes, Golang, Nix, Podman, Earthly (CD)  |
